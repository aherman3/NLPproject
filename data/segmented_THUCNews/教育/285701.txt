 纽约 电影 学院 
 The New York Film Academy was designed for a new generation of filmmakers , screenwriters , actors , producers and animators who share a passion for motion pictures and want to learn by making the ir own projects in a hands - on , intensive program . Each student writes , produces , directs , and edits each film , then screens it and engages in constructive discussion and critique 。 
 Filmmaking demands the integration of many kinds of knowledge . It is the integration of knowledge that distinguishes the New York Film Academy from many o ther film schools . In our courses students learn not only how to operate a camera , light a scene , or edit film . They learn how all the aspects of filmmaking relate to , interact with , and depend upon each o ther 。 
 The many different programs of the New York Film Academy share a philosophy that balances in-class instruction by award - winning filmmakers with an intense exploration of the medium through practical , hands - on work . For us , learning by doing means requiring each student to make a series of short films . This takes the m through the entire filmmaking process 。
